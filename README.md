## 🏗️ Tech Stack

This project is built using a **modern web technology stack** to ensure scalability and security.

### 🌐 Backend:

* **Node.js + Express.js** – RESTful API with structured endpoints
* **Sequelize / Prisma ORM** – Database management and migrations
* **JWT Authentication** – Secure user authentication
* **PostgreSQL** – Scalable relational database
* **Swagger / Postman** – API documentation and testing

### 🌍 Frontend:

* **React.js** – Component-based UI
* **Axios** – API calls to interact with the backend
* **Material UI / Bootstrap** – UI styling and responsiveness

---

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
* **PostgreSQL** (latest version)
